# Official Reddit App Accounts API 

This Repository provides functions to compute the HMAC signed headers, required for
the official accounts.reddit.com/api/login endpoint. This endpoint will respond with a 
session cookie that can be used to get an Access Token.

### SigningKey Function

Context: __a__ function in class com.reddit.auth.data.b

Argument **object** is the JSON body of the request.

{"username":"whatsadis2","password":"---------"}

Looks like the argument for the native method decryptSigningKey is irrelevant:
                decryptSigningKey = "8c7abaa5f905f70400c81bf3a1a101e75f7210104b1991f0cd5240aa80c4d99d"

                arg = "a0c1e177d7afd4faaa3ee14f6ef712917c576a33dccd7381c63fed3312658bd8"

most of the methods of the __f__ class are Null-Checks, the String arg is irrelevant

The a() method of the c class returns 0

### Client-Vendor-ID

The Client-Vendor-ID is assigned at install. Right now it is not clear if the ID
is provided by the server at install, or if it is generated by the app itself at
install.

__Update__: The ID is generated with the java.util.UUID class. 

### x-reddit-loid

To compute the __x-reddit-loid__ header the app uses a SessionContext object which 
inherits from SessionState. Programmning this from scratch will be probably impossible.

__Update__: The header is not required.
